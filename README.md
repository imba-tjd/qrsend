# QR Send

This is a fork of https://github.com/sdushantha/qr-filetransfer.

* I don't need upload and auth
* I want a shorter exe name
* I want a smaller QR code pattern
* I don't need DEFLATED when make_archive because it's inefficient
* I changed the code's filename so it makes no sense to keep upstream's commit history
* When make_archive, it's stored into temp dir. So that it won't overwrite files that have the same name, and it's OK to shutdown ungracefully
* Implemented a function to add it to *SendTo* context menu

## Usage

```cmd
pip install git+https://github.com/imba-tjd/qrsend  # pipx is preferred
qrsend file.txt/folder
```

## Won't fix

* In memory zip. The logic difference is too large. http.server works by reading local files. And according to the docs, ZipFile only accept path-like-obj now rather than file-like-obj in Py2, let alone make_archive.
* Accept-Ranges: bytes. http.server doesn't support yetï¼Œsee https://bugs.python.org/issue42643
